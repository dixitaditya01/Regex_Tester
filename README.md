## Lessons Learned

I have learnt Django python frameword, and I thought of practising
my learning by implementing a hands on project. I also revised 
upon my Regex skills. Was also able to learn new things in the Jinja2
template. Also used git in this project to keep track of versions, which 
helped me in revising on the git commands.
